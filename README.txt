LIST OF ADDITIONAL FEATURES INCLUDED IN MY PROJECT:

1. GUI- I built a GUI for customizing the simulation the user wishes to run, to use it, simply run python main.py and you'll have there a "help"
button explaining all the instruction for how to use it.

2. I added a statistic checking for each walker how many steps per race he "lead the race" on average, meaning how many times per race he was furthest from the origin. I also plotted this in the graphs so it can be visually seen.

3. I added a feature that for each customized simulation you design and run, it will plot the first simulation and show the movement of each walker across the simulation.

4. I added a new type of walker called "NoRepeatWalker" which can move in one of 4 discrete directions one step in each turn, however he can't repeat a movement in the direction he did in his previous move.

5. I added Type Annotations to my project for better readability and maintainability of my code.

6. I added the option of running a simulation not only with different walker types but also include walkers of the same type.

FURTHER EXPLANATION ON INTERESTING FEATURES:

1) GUI:
		The GUI was the largest additional feature done in the project. I designed it to allow the user to comfortably customize the simulation he would like to run, and get an immediate visual response. The UI is split into three sections, each serving a different purpose. Section 1 includes the addition of Walkers to the simulation, where the user can select the walker types and amounts he'd like to add to the simulation.
