Instructions for how to use the Random Walk Simulation App:

The App is split into three sections:

- Step 1: Selecting the walkers you want for the simulation

- Step 2: Selecting the barriers and portal gates you'd like to add to the simulation

- Step 3: Choosing the number of simulations and number of steps per simulation

It is reccomended to go in order, however, you can choose to do Step 2 before Step 1 if you'd wish to, 
but Step 3 should be done only once Step 1 and Step 2 are completed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The program won't run the simulation unless at least one walker is added to the simulation, and num of steps and num of simulations are positive Integers.


Step 1:

	a) Select a walker type you'd like to add from the dropdown list
	
	b) If you selected "Biased Walker" you must enter probabilities for each direction,
	it can be any positive number and the app normalizes it based on all the probabilities you entered to sum 1:
	
		1) Up probability- probability for walker to move upwards in each turn
		2) Down probability- probability for walker to move downwards in each turn
		3) Left probability- probability for walker to move left in each turn
		4) Right probability- probability for walker to move upwards in each turn
		5) To Origin probability- probability for walker to move towards the origin in each turn
		
	It's important to note that you must enter a positive number for at least one of the probabilities and the rest can be non negative
	
	c) If you selected any other walker the next step will be to enter the amount of this walker type you'd like to add to the simulation
	
	d) Next you click the "Add Walker" button and if the parameters were okay the walker you selected will be added to the simulation and
	will be presented in the Treeview table below, otherwise an appropriate error message will be presented
	
	e) After adding the walkers you may at any point select the walker on the table and click "Remove Walker" if you'd like to remove it from 
	the simulation

Step 2:

	a) Select the obstacle you'd like to add from the dropdown list
	b) Enter the name you'd like to give the obstacle
	c) Enter a float number for X,Y,Width,Height parameters, the X,Y represent the coordiantes of the bottom left corner of the obstacle
	d) If "Portal Gate" was selected from the dropdown, enter a float for Dest X, Dest Y which represents the destination
	you'd like to teleport the walker if it enters the portal gate bounds
	e) Next click the "Add Obstacle" button and if the parameters are all valid it will add the obstacle to the Obstacles Treeview Table
	f) Similarly to Step 1, you may at any point select an obstacle and remove it clicking the "Remove Obstacle" button

Step 3:

	a) Enter the number of simulations you'd like to run
	b) Enter the number of steps you'd like per simulation
	c) Select the path to save stats, it's optional, if left empty it will be saved
	to the directory from where you ran the project.
	d) Click "Run simulation" to run your customized simulation!
